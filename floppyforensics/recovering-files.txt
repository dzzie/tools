If you saw the experiment log that was up in this place then welcome back.

If not, then you missed watching the learnign curve and discover in action,
but you will not get the benifit of the abridged and conclusive version.

So the topic of the day is how to undelete files from a FAT12 partition.
To keep the matter concise and managable we are going to work with floppy
disks to not only limit the amout of data we must sift through but also 
so that we dont accidently corrupt or hardrives and loose any data.

First matter of business is to get a quick overview of the disk format. There
are many ways to look at the structure of a disk, but i think the healthiest
way for us to look at it with a couple preconceptions.

1) A floppy is just one large binary file to be read and manipulated, just like
patching an exe

2) Sections of this binary file are read and parsed and everything is in a very
defined and logical standardized format.

3) When a file is deleted its contents are not deleted from the disk, like wise
the record of the file name and location is only marked as "deleted" but is not
overwritten.

ok thats probably enough for now, just rember..this is all logic, no magic !

On to the sections of a disk.

---------------------  <-- 1 sector  -- Starts at 0

|     FAT #1         | <-- 6 sectors -- Starts at 200h

|   Data Section     | <--Remainder of disk -- Starts @ 4200h
|____________________| 

a) Dos Boot Code - small executable code found on the disk in the first sector
	1 sector = 512 bytes...512 decimal = 200 hex, this is reserved area that
        is used to store a system boot loader code if this was a boot disk. If itnt
        then this code is accessed and this is what pops up the nonSystem disk error
        message if you boot with the disk in the floppy. This small program is only
        run by the bios on boot up. I tried to replace it with a small asm hello world
	but my guess that the first two bytes being EB 3C or in asm Jmp 3c for the 
        entry point were off..the system just hung..unless even inttrupt functions
        are not available yet on boot disk? anyway..it appears that for expplorer to 
        access the disk at all it must parse a small section of the boot track. Here 
        is the minimum i have found through experiment to be needed to access the disk
        normally. (so each of these fields must contain data that is parsed in some 
	manner to access the disk)

b) FAT tables. There are two of these each 6 sectors long. The second one is not read
 	unless the first one is damaged. The FAT is more or less a map file here is the
	FAT table of a disk containing a single file and that files corrosponding
	directory entry.

The File Allocation Table (FAT) holds a listing of which directory entries are
being used. The FAT format is a packed bit layout which means every entry takes
up 1.5 bytes and the bytes are not contigious. That makes no sense in words i know
so heres an example. in the FAT table above every 3 bytes is 2 entries. lets look
at the entry FF 0F 00 (bytes 3-5) when we unpack and swap these bits around (we will
go into more detail and make a program to do it for us latter) the 2 entries we get
are FFF and 000. FFF means that this cluster contains the End of File (EOF) marker.
The 000 value denotes that there is no corrosponding directory entry in the next slot
yet. 

Since the Directory entry is easier to grasp we will start with that. Here is the
exerpt from the "DiskDoctor" (note this was written before support for long filenames!)

----------------
Each directory entry is 32 bytes long: there are 16 entries
    per sector, laid out so:                 ;These are our values for each over here

         file name          bytes 0-7        ; "HELLO  "
         extension          bytes 8-10       ; "ASM"
         attributes         byte 11          ; 20h
         reserved space     bytes 12-21      ; 18 7F 71 3C 8B 29 8B 29 00 00
         time stamp         bytes 22-23      ; C0 46
         date stamp         bytes 24-25      		    ; 89 29
         starting cluster   bytes 26-27 (an integer)        ; 02 00
         length (bytes)     bytes 28-31 (a 4-byte integer)  ; 75 00 00 00
-----------------

If filename > 8 characters then it changes the entry to a long filename format
If extension > 3 characters then it changes the entry to long filename format

if filename first character is E5h then file has been marked as deleted by windows
	note that only this first byte is changed! rest of entry is intact. Only 
	other change on disk is that the FAT table entry has be zeroed.

Attributes our attribute entry is 20h (32 decimal) or 0010 0000 in binary, as far
        as flags are concerned this means bit 5 is set. below is the flag table
	from "DiskDoctor"
-----------------------------
       bit number 7654 3210     
our value: 20h -> 0010 0000
            bit 0 means the file is read only
            bit 1 means the file is hidden
            bit 2 means it is a system file
            bit 3 means it is a volume label, not a file
            bit 4 means it is a subdirectory
            bit 5 is an archive bit
            bits 6 and 7 are unused at present
--------------------------------

 This shows that this file is marked with the archieve bit set. Goto File properties
from explorer and the associated checkbox is set. Just for fun i set bits 6 and 7 and
unset 5. result...file appears but opens as zero length file. setting bit 5 as well 
had no effect. setting the flags for both subdirectory and archieve made the file
appear as a folder. when you opened the folder it was full of folders andfiles that
were named with the contents of the files text..wacky

Starting Cluster is a byte swapped integer mapping which cluster the file begins
at. Note that this is not the physical cluster layout of the disk. Since the
beginning of the disk is used for house keeping the data area is said to start 
at cluster 2 which starts at offset 4200h ! 

our value 02 00 -> byteswap() -> 0002 or cluster 2. The first available data
cluster on disk starting at byte offset 4200h. 

Filelength: our value = 75h -> 117 dec = character length

Since each sector (cluster) is 200h long. This file fits nicely inside one cluster.
Since a cluster is the smallest allocatable chunk given out, there will be 125h 
unused space between the end of this file and the beginning of the next one. Also
since this file fits all the single cluster the FAT only has to record that the
beginning cluster pointed to by the directory entry is also the sector containing
that files End Of File (EOF).

So what happens if a file is longer than one cluster? we know how to find the 
beginning of it...how do we locate where the rest of the file lies? Well since files
can be deleted we can not depend on each section of the file being laid out in one
contigious block. To know where to look next the operating system will go back to the
File Allocation Table and check to see what cluster holds the next section of the file.

The best way to drill this into your (and my) brain is to do a small experiment
and see it all happen. Lets save another file to the disk that is several sectors
big to see how it changes the disk layout.

one file that fits in single cluster

examine fat entries		

a)   F0 FF FF 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ðÿÿ.............  
b)   F0 FF FF FF 0F 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ðÿÿÿ............  
c)   F0 FF FF FF 4F 00 05 F0  FF 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ðÿÿÿO..ðÿ.......  
     
a) contains no files, first 3 bytes reserved (first 2 entries)

b) contains one file, of the byte FF 0F the zero has yet to be filled it will be
	part of the next entry for the next file saved (because of the packed order
	of FAT) so this fat entry is FFF which indicates that the start cluster
	defined in teh directory entry is also the cluster that contains that files
	EOF, so not further info is needed on this file.

c) here another file has been added to the disk used above. the file added was
	1030bytes long. which means it encompasses 3 clusters. The cluster pointed
	at in directory entry is 03 00 (0003) or the third. then to find the other
	2 segments of the file we look at the FAT entry for it. 4x 00 05 F0 FF
	unpacked this = 004 005 FFF. this tells us that the next cluster is 4 then 5
	and that cluster 5 contains the EOF.      

Now that we see how that works. Lets jump right into a real world example :)
Below is the FAT to another floppy disk. how many files does this represent? 
and what clusters can they be foudn at? (if you havent noticed i like to drill
in the basics and concepts at depth then jump off the deep end :)

Ok the first part of this looks easy

 reserved-----|        |-----2 Single Sector Files
           |------| |------|       
00000200   F0 FF FF FF FF FF FF FF  FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF   ðÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ
00000210   FF FF FF FF FF 0F 00 01  11 20 01 13 40 01 15 60   ÿÿÿÿÿ.... ..@..`

for all the single sector fiels every 3 FF bytes denotes 2 files
that brings us to thats 6 files each one cluster from 2-8

noW scan teh large block for where the next FFF EOF marker is. 
nicely enough it is at the end..so there is only
one more file to account for but it is a doozie ;) so what clusters can
it eb foudn in?  we dontknow the start cluster becase thats in the directory
entry...but form the FAT we can tell it goes from :

-------------
format refresher AB CD EF -> DAB EFC

also note that since every 3 bytes = 2 files, and 16 is not divisible by 3
that you cannot get into the easy pattern of relating byte position in editor
to which conversion you are on! 
-------------

0F 00 01 -> 00F, 010
11 20 01 -> 011, 012
13 40 01 -> 013, 014
15 60 01 -> 015, 016
17 80 01 -> 017, 018

we could go on for quite some time...but i think it is time to automate this
yes no?

so basic logic goes like this...grab hex block, since every 3 bytes carries 2 entries
makes sense to use this fact to simplify the parsing.Basic logic outline:

dim b1,b2,b3 as string
'pattern we wish to accomplish 
'    AB CD EF -> DAB EFC
'    b1 b2 b3 LoWord = right most character of byte (hex format) converse for HighWord
for i=0 to ubound(byte) step 3
	b1=byte(i)
	b2=byte(i+1)
	b3=byte(i+3)

	entry1 = LoWord(b2) & b1
        entry2 = b3 & HiWord(b2)
next

see the sample app for full working version. anyway we find the file contigeous 
from 00F - 0FE

since this file is not fragmented at all...even if teh file had been deleted 
and the fat entry wiped...we could have recovered the file in its entirity from
disk knowing only the start file offset found in the remainder of the directory entry.
(rember only the first byte of the directory entry is overwritten when a file is
deleted and none of the data is wiped from disk!) (or didnt we get that far yet?)
