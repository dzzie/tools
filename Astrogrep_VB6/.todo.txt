astrogrep: show file size and progress bar
           for regex of gigantic files let regex do the parsing of file not eol based.

problem: Searchcode.bas - textLine = getLineOfInput(file)
         it is only designed to search text files with crlf endings...not a real grep
         a large file with only \n endings = hang..binary file would be bad too
         and it reads the files one byte at a time...
         do/while:  textLine = textLine + Input(1, fileNum)
